Overview:
The purpose of this analysis was to design and evaluate machine learning models to predict the credit risk of loans. In this assignment, I classified loans as either healthy (label 0) or high-risk (label 1). This helps financial institutions to assess which applicants may pose a higher risk compared to others. 

The dataset consisted of financial and demographic information about loan applicants. When focusing on the "loan_status" column, 0 represented a healthy loan and 1 represented a high-risk loan. As I analyzed the data as a whole, I found significantly more healthy loans accounted for when compared to high-risk ones.

I followed the standarg stages in the supervised machine learning process, including:
Data preprocessing/cleaning
Scaling
Train-test split
Model selection and training using LogisticRegression
Model evaluation using a confusion matrix and classification report
